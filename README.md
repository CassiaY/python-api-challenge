Module 6 challenge  
Contributor: Cassia Yoon  

Assignment Background:  
Data's true power is its ability to definitively answer questions. So, let's take what you've learned about Python requests,APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?" Now, we know what you may be thinking: “That’s obvious. It gets hotter.” But, if pressed for more information, how would you prove that?  

- API used: https://openweathermap.org/api
- Also used the citypy Python library: https://pypi.org/project/citipy/

My scripts can be found in the folder 'WeatherPy'. The output_data folder contains a csv file of the data obtained from the APIs at the time of writing script and output png files of the graphs created based on the city data collected.
